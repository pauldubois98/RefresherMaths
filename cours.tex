	\paragraph{Presentation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Paul Dubois
		\item will be teaching this refresher math course
		\item email (for any question), answer within 1 working day
	\end{itemize}
	\paragraph{Course Format}
	\subparagraph{Lectures}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 8*3h
		\item 1h20min lecture - $\nicefrac{1}{3}$h break - 1h20min lecture
		\item No pb class planned, but lectures will have integrated live exercises
		\item Interrupt if needed (but may also ask at the end of the lecture)
		\item Lectures are recorded (if ever needed)
		\item 1st lecture ever => too fast/too slow: let me know
		\item May assume you know a concept/notation that you have never heard of, let me know if this happens
	\end{itemize}
	\subparagraph{Examination}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The course is pass/fail
		\item Most (in fact hopefully all) of you will pass
		\item There will be a full exercise sheet per lecture, it is advised to attempt it all (only one will be compulsory).
		\item Hand-in 1 exercise per lecture (i.e., 8 in total), due 2 weeks after the lecture
		\item Best $\nicefrac{(n-1)}{n}$ count (i.e., best $\nicefrac{7}{8}$ in our case), need avg $\geq 50 \%$ to pass
		\item In the unlikely event of not passing, will be able to do an extra work
	\end{itemize}
